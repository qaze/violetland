# Common #

  * A roadmap with the accepted ideas from this list.
  * Pdf user manual in all supported languages.
  * A common engine of tooltips which is integrated with current user control framework.
  * Split violetland into two parts - a library that does main processing and a client that uses opengl to render gamestate.
  * Installer for windows package.

# Graphics #

  * Don't use opengl lighting, use multitexturing.
  * Switch in options that controls amount of blood in game: less blood (for slow machines to work around [issue 35](https://code.google.com/p/violetland/issues/detail?id=35)), medium blood (as is now), more blood (for those players who likes blood, sometimes want to see blood just gushing out of the screen).
  * Muzzleslash
  * Persistent shells on the ground

# Gameplay #

  * Some obstacles on map as new game mode (rocks - shelter from the bullets, trees - where monsters can be hidden).

## Monsters ##

  * Monster which can shoot.
  * Monster which can teleport (he should has short teleport range and should do some preparations (visible to player) just before teleportation.
  * Monster which goes to player and explodes, damages player (kamikaze) (player can shoot him to damage some other monsters).
  * Invisible monster (he can be "visible" like in DOOM-1 or totally invisible).

## Perks ##

  * Player can have two weapons simultaneously (may be various rules).
  * Perks as tree instead of plain list.
  * Standard flamethrower does not burn monsters, just hurts them. When you take the Napalm perk, it loades your grenades, M-32 and flamethrower with napalm. I want to make monsters burn and flap, fled in random direction and burn all in its path.
  * Nuclear grenades.

## Powerups ##

  * Madness - like a bomb, but instead of instant damage in range monsters will eat each other.
  * Vodka - health will be immediately restored, but for some time player will shoot and go not exactly in right direction.
  * Shield - player will become immortal for some time.

## Weapons ##

  * Gattling gun (like minigun in Crimsonland: player speed decreases, but weapon have big holder, high shooting rate and powerfull bullets).
  * Mines.
