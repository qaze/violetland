Hi all. I came up with a idea of the quest based on current violetland setting.

This is a scenario plus some technical details.

# Part 1 #

## Introduction ##

Violet stay around a helicopter. No monsters around.

Message: "Something strange was happened. An unknown object appeared in the area and generates terrible creatures. You are Violet, soldier of top secret team. You been sent to try to destroy this object. Go forth to where from the monsters are coming."

## Action ##

There is the array of 20\*20 standard survival areas. Violet can move between areas by just going beyond the boundaries of the area. Violet can then return to previous visited area (should state of area been saved?). The start position is always in center of area 10:10. The coordinates of "unknown object" will be generated at game start and can be 0:0, 0:20, 20:0 and 20:20. Monsters are generated as in standard survival, but more often with the side on which the "unknown object" is placed relative to the current Violet position, so player can understand where is the "unknown object". Player can gain level, and use any bonuses.

# Part 2 #

## Introduction ##

Violet enters to area where is the "unknown object" placed.

Message: "You see a blob from your nightmare! All surrounded by a strange field, you can't teleport! You should destroy it at all cost!"

## Action ##

Violet can't use teleports in area where is the "unknown object" placed. The goal is to destroy the object that never ceases to engender monsters and is very healthy.

# Part 3 #

## Introduction ##

Violet destroys the "unknown object".

Message: "The blob explodes and scattered around their spores! Damn, you should immediately run out of here! Retreat to the helicopter now!"

## Action ##

Now the blob is not exists, but more powerful monsters are generated everywhere randomly. Violet can use teleports and should return to helicopter.

# Part 4 #

## Introduction ##

Violet come to the helicopter.

Message: "Damn, the pilots are dead! You should go away from this area, have to work legs."

## Action ##

Violet is now in area 10:10 (helicopter location) and should go away. To win the game, move to -1:x, x:-1, x:21 or 21:x.
